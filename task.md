# Setting Up Monitoring with Grafana

<hr>

### Objective
  As a member of the DevOps team for the 5 projects, you are responsible for setting up a comprehensive monitoring solution using Grafana. This will include integrating Grafana with Prometheus for metrics collection, setting up dashboards, and configuring alerts to ensure that the projects are effectively monitored and any issues are promptly addressed.

## Overview
You will configure Grafana to monitor the 5 projects, which involves:
 - Setting up Grafana and Prometheus.
 - Creating and configuring dashboards.
 - Setting up alerts.
 - Ensuring proper data retention and access control.

### Instructions:

1. Grafana and Prometheus Installation:
 - Install Prometheus:
   - Deploy Prometheus on a Linux server or use a managed Prometheus service.
   - Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the services you need to monitor.
   - Store the Prometheus configuration file (`prometheus.yml`) in `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`.
 - Install Grafana:
   - Deploy Grafana on the same server or a separate server.
   - Ensure Grafana can access Prometheus by configuring Prometheus as a data source in Grafana.
   - Save Grafana configuration settings in `/etc/grafana/grafana.ini`.
 - Dashboard Setup:
   - Create Dashboards:
      - Develop Grafana dashboards for each project to visualize key metrics.
      - Use pre-built Grafana dashboards for common services or create custom dashboards to fit your project needs.
      - Ensure dashboards cover essential metrics like _CPU usage_, _memory usage_, _disk I/O_, _network traffic_, and _application-specific metrics_.
   - Dashboard Configuration:
      - Configure visualizations such as _graphs_, _tables_, and _heatmaps_.
      - Set up variables for dynamic dashboard updates (e.g., `project names`, `environments`).
      - Save dashboards and ensure they are accessible to the relevant team members.
 - Alerting Configuration:
   - Set Up Alerts:
     - Configure alerts in Grafana based on the metrics collected by Prometheus.
     - Create alert rules for critical metrics that may indicate issues (e.g., `high CPU usage`, `low memory`, `application errors`).
     - Set up notification channels (e.g., `email`, `Slack`, `PagerDuty`) to send alerts to the team.
   - Alert Testing:
      - Test alert rules to ensure that notifications are sent correctly when thresholds are breached.
      - Verify that alerts are actionable and provide relevant information for troubleshooting.
 - Data Retention and Access Control:
   - Configure Data Retention:
     - Set up data retention policies in Prometheus to manage how long historical metrics are stored.
     - Ensure that data retention aligns with project requirements and compliance needs.
    - Access Control:
      - Configure user roles and permissions in Grafana to control access to dashboards and alerts.
      - Ensure that only authorized users can modify dashboards and alert configurations.
 - Documentation:
   - Provide comprehensive documentation on the Grafana setup, including:
   - Installation steps for Grafana and Prometheus.
   - Configuration details for Prometheus scraping, Grafana dashboards, and alerting rules.
   - Instructions for accessing and managing dashboards.
   - Troubleshooting tips and best practices for maintaining the monitoring setup.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Prometheus is successfully installed and configured to collect metrics from all relevant services.
2. Grafana is set up with Prometheus as a data source and configured to display dashboards with relevant metrics.
3. Alerts are configured and tested to ensure timely notifications for critical issues.
4. Data retention policies and access controls are properly configured and documented.
5. Documentation is clear, comprehensive, and includes all necessary setup and configuration details.

## Grading
1. The setup will be evaluated based on functionality, accuracy, and completeness.
2. Mentors will review the configuration, dashboards, and alerting setup to ensure they meet the requirements.

Ensure that the monitoring solution is fully operational and addresses the needs of all 5 projects.
